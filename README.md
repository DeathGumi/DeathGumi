I'm a college senior leading a team to build a calendar app that actually makes sense. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. Why focus on calendars? Because most tools out there are either too basic or way too complicated, especially for those of us with ADHD.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Nam's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey into the world of coding wasn't a straight path. Initially, I dreamed of becoming an architect, fascinated by the idea of designing spaces. But in my junior year of high school, I stumbled upon computer science and fell in love with a different kind of design - the architecture of software.

   As I dove deeper into coding, I found myself captivated by the endless possibilities it offered. Balancing my newfound passion with my love for badminton, I navigated through high school, excited about the future in tech that lay ahead.

   College brought its own set of challenges. The rigid structure of assignments and coding tasks I didn't always connect with led to a brief falling out with programming. But as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder. It wasn't until I started working on my own app that I rediscovered my passion for coding and design.

   Living with ADHD, I've always found it challenging to use existing apps. They're either too simple, lacking essential features, or so complicated they require a tutorial just to get started. This frustration became my motivation. I decided to create my own calendar app, one that would cater to my needs and potentially help others facing similar challenges.

   Through this process, I've gained a deeper understanding of front-end and back-end development, design principles, and even psychology. I've learned to appreciate the intricate dance between functionality and user experience.

   As I continue to develop my skills, I'm exploring various paths in tech. Whether it's diving into the world of data science, honing my software engineering skills, or focusing on UX/UI design, I'm excited about the possibilities. And yes, I know I need to brush up on my algorithms too (it's always a work in progress, right?).

   This journey has taught me that it's okay to pivot, to rediscover passions, and to create solutions for problems you personally face. As I work towards landing a job in tech and continue to develop my app, I'm reminded that the most fulfilling path is often the one you carve out for yourself.
